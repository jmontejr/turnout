# turnout

This application was created through the course [Vue JS 2.0 - Mastering Web Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-web-apps/) during the lessons of Section 7: Turnout | Application Five.

This application is a social event sharing that allows you to post events in real time. This section combines the Vue Router, Vuex, Firebase and all the concepts from the previous applications in this course.

Sass was added for the style.

Note: The last update of the course was on 12/2017, however some classes continue with updated content; in the rest, during development, we always sought to implement each feature of the application in the most updated way possible.
